title: "Turbulent inflow precursor method with time-varying direction for large-eddy simulations and applications to wind farms."
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper5
excerpt: 'This paper focuses on turbulent inflow conditions for simulation of high Reynolds number wall-bounded flows. A qualitative comparison between synthetic turbulence methods and precursor inflow turbulence illustrates the better accuracy of the latter. Furthermore, the original precursor methodology is generalized to time-varying directions, and a case study involving the Horns Rev wind farm is shown.'
