In this paper the methodological framework for dynamic optimal induction control of wind farms with the aim of power maximization is elaborated. The framework is based on high fidelity large-eddy simulations combined with adjoint gradient calculations for the optimization of control variables. A case study for a wind farm with twelve rows of turbines illustrates potential power gains in the order of 15%.
