title: "Shifted periodic boundary conditions for simulations of wall-bounded turbulent flows."
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper6
excerpt: 'This paper introduces a novel type of cyclic boundary condition which imposes a spanwise shift prior to reintroducing flows variables at the domain inlet. In this way, the so-called spanwise locking effect, in which streamwise-elongated turbulent structures become self-supporting causing spurious persistence in long time averages, can be circumvented. The methodology is shown for both direct and large-eddy simulations and is applied to a wind-farm demonstration case.'

This paper introduces a novel type of cyclic boundary condition which imposes a spanwise shift prior to reintroducing flows variables at the domain inlet. In this way, the so-called spanwise locking effect, in which streamwise-elongated turbulent structures become self-supporting causing spurious persistence in long time averages, can be circumvented. The methodology is shown for both direct and large-eddy simulations and is applied to a wind-farm demonstration case.
