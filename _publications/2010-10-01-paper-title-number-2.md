title: "Dynamic strategies for yaw and induction control of wind farms based on large-eddy simulation and optimization."
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'In this paper I investigated dynamic yaw and induction control strategies for wind-farm power maximization. The main outcome of the study is that the power gains by combining both strategies are quasi additive compared to single-control strategies. Furthermore, enforcing of wake meandering by dynamic yawing was identified as a novel method for increased wake mixing in low turbulence conditions. '

In this paper I investigated dynamic yaw and induction control strategies for wind-farm power maximization. The main outcome of the study is that the power gains by combining both strategies are quasi additive compared to single-control strategies. Furthermore, enforcing of wake meandering by dynamic yawing was identified as a novel method for increased wake mixing in low turbulence conditions.
